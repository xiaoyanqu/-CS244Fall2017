This project is a team project for CS244 Embedded system HW3 from Team 15. In the folder, CS244HW3_HeartRate.m, CS244HW3_RespirationRate.m and CS244HW3_SPO2.m file are matlab programs that can be executed, providing codes to calculate heart rate, respiration rate and SPO2. Peak() and valley() function will search peaks and valleys from a series of data, whereas filtermax() and filtermin() will delete redundant data. Interpolation() is used to provide interpolation point.
